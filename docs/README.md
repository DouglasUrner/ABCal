# South Kitsap HS A/B Day Calendar

To use, either:

* Subscribe to the calendar (so it will automatically update):
  - On **macOS:** File > New Calendar Subscription
  - **All:** enter the calendar's URL **https://douglasurner.github.io/SKHScal/skdays.ics**
  - Select an update frequency, I'd suggest daily or every hour so that it remains accurate even during inclement weather.
* Download and import the **.ics** file.
