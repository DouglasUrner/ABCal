# South Kitsap HS A/B Day Calendar

To use, try one of these methods (easiest first), favor one of the subscription methods because then the calendar will be automatically updated for snow days and other exigencies:

* Subscribe automagically by clicking on the link below.

  <a href="webcal://douglasurner.github.io/SKHScal/skdays.ics">SKHS A/B Day Calendar</a>
  
  The link will attempt to add the calendar subscription to your calendar. You (should) have to give it permission to continue.

* Subscribe manually to the calendar:
  - For **macOS Calendar:**
     1. File > New Calendar Subscription
     1. Clear the alerts checkbox (unless you want to be reminded what kind of day the next day is...).
     1. Select an update frequency, I'd suggest daily or every hour so that it remains accurate even during inclement weather.
  - For **Microsoft Outlook:**
     1. Click on the calendar button in the lower left corner of the Outlook window.
     1. Right-click on My Calendars, then select **Add Calendar > From Internet...**.
  - For **Google Calendar:**
     1. Click on **Other Calendars +** in the lower left hand corner of the Google Calendar window.
     1. Click on **From URL**.
  - **All:** paste the calendar's URL **https\://douglasurner.github.io/SKHScal/skdays.ics**
  
* Download and import the [**.ics**](https://douglasurner.github.io/SKHScal/skdays.ics) file.
